# Description
This folder includes three programs
* CaesarShiftCipher.py
  * Opens a text menu and prompts for user input. The program can both encrypt and decrypt messages using a Caesar Shift Cipher, which shifts the letters of the message by some key-value specified.
* AffineCipher.py
  *  Opens a text menu and prompts for user input. The program can both encrypt and decrypt messages using the Affine Cipher, which multiplies the numerical value of a letter and then applies a shift to it. The key is specified from the user.
* Hashing.py
  * Computes numerous hash algorithms on a file input by the user. These hash algorithms are: SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, and MD5.

# Usage
This program is written in python 3, so it is important that we use
python3, instead of python 2.

`python3 CaesarShiftCipher.py`
or
`./python3 CaesarShiftCipher.py`

`python3 AffineCipher.py`
or
`./python3 AffineCipher.py`

`python3 Hashing.py`
or
`./python3 Hashing.py`

A menu will appear from there, and the user can navigate that.
