# DESCRIPTION
This folder includes three programs: CaesarShiftCipher.py, AffineCipher.py,
and Hashing.py.

The first program, CaesarShiftCipher, opens a text menu and prompts for user
input. The program can both encrypt and decrypt messages using a 
Caesar Shift Cipher, which shifts the letters of the message by some key
value specified. The second program, AffineCipher, also opens a text menu 
and prompts for user input. The program can both encrypt and decrypt messages 
using the Affine Cipher, which multiplies the numerical value of a letter and 
then applies a shift to it. The key is specified from the user. The third 
program, Hashing.py, computes numerous hash algorithms on a file input
by the user. These hash algorithms are: SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512,
and MD5.

# USAGE
This program is written in python 3, so it is important that we use
python3, instead of python.

python3 CaesarShiftCipher.py
or
./python3 CaesarShiftCipher.py

python3 AffineCipher.py
or
./python3 AffineCipher.py

python3 Hashing.py
or
./python3 Hashing.py

A menu will appear from there, and the user can navigate that.
